# Atliq Business Insight 360-Dashboard

I successfully wrapped up this project within the [Codebasics Data Analyst 2.0 Bootcamp](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance) Power BI Course.

This dashboard helps Atliq Hardware get holistic business insights: finance analysis with P&L insights, sales analytics featuring customer and product metrics, marketing view encompassing net sales to net profit, supply chain metrics with accuracy trends, and an executive view providing regional, market share, and top customer/product insights. Invaluable for strategic decision-making.

### Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a global consumer electronics company, is experiencing rapid growth across multiple countries. However, reliance on complex Excel files for data analytics has proven ineffective, leading to significant losses in Latin America. To address this, senior executives have initiated a data analytics project, assigning a dedicated team to enhance insights and decision-making. 

They initially shared 5 mockups for the various insights - Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive.

**Tools Used:** Power BI, MySQL, MS Excel, DAX, DAX Studio, Project Charter.<br>
**Skills used:** Data Modelling, Power Query, DAX, M-language.<br>
**Dataset Used:**
- dim_customer, dim_market, dim_product, fact_forecast_monthly, fact_sales_monthly, freight_cost, gross_price, manufacturing_cost, post_invoice_deductions, pre_invoice_deductions. (loaded from MySql)
- NsGmTarget, operational_expenses, marketshare. (loaded from external Excel(.xlsx) Files)

### Steps Followed for Data Preparation & Dashboard Designing

***Step 1:*** I began by employing SQL queries within MySQL Workbench for an initial dive into the data. Following a brief data exploration, here are my initial findings:
   - The database comprises a total of 13 tables from various sources: 10 of the tables come from MySQL database and 3 tables from external sources provided as .xlsx file. 
   - the database can classified into 2 major sets of data
       - The fact tables containing the quantitative information related to sales transaction details, forecast details, gross price, manufacturing cost, freight cost and pre & post invoice deductions.
       - The dimension tables containing details of customers, products & market. These encompass
           - 27 markets divided within 7 subzones (ANZ, India, LATAM, NA, NE, ROA, SE) and 4 regions (APAC, EU, LATAM, NA)
           - 73 products within 14 categories divided within 3 major divisions (N & S, P & A, PC) further subdivided into 6 segements (Accessories, Desktop, Networking, Notebook, Peripherals, Storage).
           - Atliq has 74 unique customers accross the globe.<br>
   - The complete observation period considering both sales transaction and sales forecast data spans from September 2017 to August 2022.
   - Fiscal Year observed by Atliq is from September to August.
   - The transaction data is denominated in USD.

***Step 2:*** After gaining a foundational understanding of the data, I initiated the **ETL(Extract, Transform, Load)** process. My observations:
   - It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "region" in dim_market dataset.
   - There was no date dimension table in the dataset hence created one named dim_date in power query and added calculated columns to it for computing fiscal years.
   - For the above process I used dates from  fact_forecast_monthly & fact_sales_monthly dataset as a reference to create this table.


***Step 3:*** Following the completion of initial transformations, I proceeded to load the refined data into the primary report and started with the subsequent phase of **data modeling** laying the foundation for a robust analytical framework.<br><br>

   - I used a snowflake schema to connect the various tables loaded.

***Step 4:*** Next came the data validation phase, where I received benchmark numbers from the project owner. Upon scrutinizing my data against these benchmarks, an observation surfaced:
   - Uncovered a discrepancy of 376K in the total forecast quantity, which on further inspection was revealed stemmed from a data quality issue.
   - Swiftly collaborating with the data engineering team, rectified the issue.

***Step 5:*** Once I was confirmed my data was clean and ready I started with the dashboard designing. This intricate process entailed the creation of remaining calculated columns and measures, employing the power of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and finally building the visuals required ensuring a harmonious blend of meaningful insights and aesthetic appeal.

***Step 6:*** The final step in the process was performance optimization of the dashboard. By leveraging DAX Studio, I fine-tuned the dashboard's performance, achieving a remarkable 30% reduction in file size and significantly faster data loading. This optimization guarantees a seamless experience, enhancing the efficiency of data exploration and visualization.

### Dashboard Explained

This dashboard will serve as a central hub with links to specialized views focusing on different aspects of the business, such as finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive-level insights.

Some common pointers about the insight views:
   - I have added filter criteria where data can be easily filtered by market, region, customers, products, segments, categories, fiscal years, fiscal quarters, YTD(Year-To-Date)/YTG(Year-To-Go).
   - The sales, finance & executive view also include a dedicated filter each, enabling a more granular drill-down into the data for comparisons with the previous year or target metrics.
